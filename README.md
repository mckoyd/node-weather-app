# Weather App Demo

## Starting the App

#### Locally:

Create a file named `.env` to store your weather key (from weatherstack.com), your map key (from api.mapbox.com), and the port you would like to use.
Run `npm i` to install all dependencies, then `npm start` to start the server. The client will be available on the localhost domain at the port of your choice.
